## Neural Network Paradigm

Jarviso's neural fabric, represented in `CoreBrain`, is visualized as a binary classifier. It discerns whether a query should be addressed using homegrown knowledge or if it requires an intricate solution.

- **Architecture**: 
  - **Input Layer**: Welcomes embeddings.
  - **Dense Layers**: Churns the data.
  - **Output Layer**: Yields a binary output.

- **Training Regimen**: 
  - **Embeddings**: User queries translated into numerical vectors.
  - **Decisions**: The gold-standard answers.

## SQLite Database

- **Purpose**: Offers a nimble, local storage solution.
- **Usage**: Archives user interactions, feedback, and pivotal system data.
- **Interactions**: Multiple modules/functions engage in reading/writing to this database.

## Interdependencies and Workflow

1. **`main.py`**:
  - Invokes `interact_with_user()` from `jarviso.py`.

2. **`jarviso.py`**:
  - Relies on `dialogue_manager.py` for response crafting.
  - Engages `context_manager.py` to access/update conversation history.
  - Newly added: 
    - **WordNet Integration**: Utilizes `wordnet_utils.py` to refine responses, extracting more contextually apt synonyms, and ensuring semantic accuracy.

3. **`dialogue_manager.py`**:
  - Employs `model/core_brain.py` for predictions.
  - Engages `api_handlers` for external source responses.
  - Taps into `knowledge_helpers` for predefined knowledge and web scavenging.

4. **`context_manager.py`**:
  - Offers conversation context for apt replies.
  - Influences other modules with historical data.

## Modern Enhancements

- **WordNet Integration**: A significant stride forward, where Jarviso now leverages the linguistic richness of WordNet to:
  - Refine responses, ensuring they're contextually apt.
  - Augment understanding through synonyms, definitions, and hypernyms.
  - This addition enhances Jarviso's semantic depth, allowing it to engage in more nuanced conversations.

- **Caching & Adaptation Mechanism**: An intelligent caching system to store frequent queries and responses, reducing the need to always refer to the XML WordNet and adapt to user preferences.

- **Feedback Integration**: A mechanism for users to provide feedback on Jarvis's responses, which is then utilized to continuously refine and improve Jarvis's understanding and responses.
