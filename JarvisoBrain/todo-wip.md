## Connections Needed:

### Brain Regions to Database:
- Several brain regions process data but do not have a clear mechanism for storing or retrieving historical data from the SQLite database.
- Especially, areas like `AuditoryCortex`, `VisualCortex`, and `PrefrontalCortex` would benefit from direct interactions with the database to aid decision-making.

### Neuromodulatory Systems to Neurons:
- The neuromodulatory systems influence neuron activities. However, there's no clear communication or influence mechanism in place for systems like the `DopamineSystem` or `SerotoninSystem` on specific neurons.

### Event Management to Main Brain:
- The `event_manager` dispatches events, but it's unclear how these events influence the main brain's operation or decision-making process.

### Utilities to Brain Regions:
- Signal processing and visualization tools in the `Utils` directory need clearer connections to the brain regions they serve.

## Completions Needed:

### Database Schema and Interactions:
- The structure of the SQLite database (`NeuralDatabase`) and its tables needs clearer definition.
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the database should be elaborated upon.

### Brain Region Functionalities:
- Some brain regions, such as the `BasalGanglia` and `Hippocampus`, have placeholder methods. Their exact functionalities and algorithms need to be defined and implemented.

### Neuron Activations:
- The activation and communication mechanisms for some neurons, especially in the `MotorNeurons` and `SensoryNeurons` directories, need to be completed.

### Synapse Mechanisms:
- The `Synapses` directory contains several synapse types, but the exact mechanisms of how they influence neuron activities need further elaboration.

### Utilities Enhancements:
- Tools in the `Utils` directory, especially `signal_processing` and `visualization`, need more comprehensive algorithms and functionalities.

## TODO:
- Establish direct connections between critical brain regions and the database.
- Implement the influence mechanism of neuromodulatory systems on neurons.
- Define the event influence on the main brain's operation.
- Connect utilities to relevant brain regions.
- Define and implement the database schema and CRUD operations.
- Complete the functionalities of specific brain regions.
- Define and implement neuron activation mechanisms.
- Elaborate on synapse mechanisms and their influence on neurons.
- Enhance utilities with more functionalities and algorithms.
