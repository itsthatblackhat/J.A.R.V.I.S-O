## 6. Interactions and Flow

1. Sensory inputs (e.g., audio, visual) are captured and processed by their respective cortices.
2. Processed data is then sent to the `PrefrontalCortex` for decision-making.
3. The `PrefrontalCortex` evaluates the data, makes decisions, and sends commands to the `MotorNeurons` for action.
4. All activities and data are logged and can be stored in the SQLite database.
5. An event-driven architecture, managed by the `EventDispatcher`, ensures efficient communication between different components.

## 7. Database Interaction

The system uses an SQLite database (`mainbrain.db`) to store various types of data, including brain activity logs, sensory data, and processed information. This central database acts as the brain's long-term memory, enabling data retrieval for decision-making and other processes.

## 8. Emotion and Feedback Systems

The feedback system is designed to emulate emotions by adjusting the brain's chemical balance based on external stimuli. This helps in training the brain and refining its decision-making capabilities.

## 9. Signal Processing and Visualization

The system processes raw sensory data, be it visual, auditory, or somatosensory. After processing, the data can be visualized for further analysis, aiding in understanding and refining the brain's responses.

## 10. Chemicals and Emulation of Feelings

The system can emulate feelings by adjusting the balance of virtual "chemicals" in response to feedback. This influences decision-making and other processes, adding a layer of complexity and adaptability to the system.
