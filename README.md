# Jarviso

Jarviso is an advanced neural network-driven assistant, inspired by JARVIS from the Iron Man movies. Its primary goal is to simulate human-like interactions, learn from those interactions, and provide relevant and informed responses.

## Features

### Core Brain

The core of Jarviso is based on a neural network implemented using TensorFlow. It's trained to make decisions based on user input embeddings.

### Active Learning

Jarviso uses an active learning approach. Every 10 interactions, Jarviso queries the user for feedback on specific uncertain interactions. This feedback helps in refining and improving its responses.

### Dynamic Curiosity

One of the unique features of Jarviso is its ability to ask questions proactively:

- **Dynamic Question Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate curious questions about various topics.
  
- **Contextual Curiosity**: Based on frequent topics the user asks about, Jarviso can pose a curious question related to that topic.

### User Feedback Loop

After each interaction, users provide feedback on Jarviso's response. This feedback is critical for the system's continuous learning.

### Bing Search Integration

If Jarviso doesn't know an answer, it can search Bing for relevant information, ensuring that the user's questions are addressed even if the answer isn't immediately known.

### User Context

Jarviso maintains a context of user interactions. This context includes user preferences and frequently asked questions. It aids in tailoring responses and deciding when to introduce curious questions.

## Installation & Setup

(Here, you would typically include details about how to set up and run Jarviso, any prerequisites, required libraries, etc.)

## Usage

To interact with Jarviso:

\```python
from src.jarviso import interact_with_user
interact_with_user()
\```

(Note: For the above python code block to work in your README, remove the `\` before the three backticks.)

## Future Enhancements

As Jarviso evolves, we aim to:

1. Incorporate more data sources for improved knowledge.
2. Integrate more advanced NLP techniques for better understanding and generation of language.
3. Use reinforcement learning for better decision-making based on user feedback.
