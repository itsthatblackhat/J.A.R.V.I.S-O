## Introduction

In an age where AI permeates every facet of our lives, Jarviso stands out, not just for its intelligence but also for its adaptability, context-awareness, and thirst for knowledge. Whether you're a novice user or a tech titan like Elon Musk, Jarviso promises a seamless and enlightening experience.

## Features

- **Contextual Conversations:** Unlike standard AIs that treat each query in isolation, Jarviso remembers. It intelligently maintains a history, paving the way for meaningful dialogues.
- **Versatile Response Mechanisms:** Whether it's a local neural network, a vast knowledge base, the power of GPT, or even a browser-based search, Jarviso meticulously selects the best route to answer your query.
- **Curiosity Mode:** Every so often, Jarviso's innate curiosity is piqued, prompting it to delve deeper into topics, mutually enhancing its knowledge and your experience.
- **Dynamic and Modular:** Jarviso's architecture isn't just robust—it's dynamic. This means the potential for expansions, custom modules, and integrations is limitless.

## Deep Dive: How Jarviso Works

Jarviso is not magic—it's science, and here's a breakdown:

1. **Dialogue Management:** The heart of the interaction, this module determines the best strategy to generate a response.
2. **Contextual Memory:** Think of this as Jarviso's short-term memory. It holds the conversation history, ensuring the AI's responses are contextually apt.
3. **Knowledge Extraction:** Before resorting to complex computations, Jarviso checks its knowledge base—a repository of pre-defined answers.
4. **Decision Making:** A local neural network trained on embeddings. This is Jarviso's brain, where it makes decisions based on patterns it has learned.
5. **API Interactions:** For some queries, Jarviso taps into the power of external giants like GPT, seamlessly integrating their capabilities into its responses.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Get the Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jarviso.git
cd jarviso
```
2. **Dependencies:** Jarviso stands on the shoulders of giants. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **API Configuration:** To converse with external entities, you'll need to set up API keys. Edit `config/api_keys.json` with your credentials.

## User Guide

Starting a conversation with Jarviso is as simple as:
```bash
python main.py
```
Now, just type away! Pose your questions, and experience the intelligence of Jarviso in real-time.

## For the Enthusiasts: Under the Hood

If you're someone who loves to tinker, or perhaps you're Lex Fridman, diving deep into AI research, Jarviso's modular design is a paradise. Each component, from the dialogue manager to the API handlers, has been meticulously crafted, allowing for easy expansions and deep dives into specific functionalities.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Type Errors:** Ensure all items in the context manager are strings. Non-string types can cause unexpected errors.
- **TensorFlow Warnings:** TensorFlow, being a dynamic beast, sometimes has compatibility quirks. Ensure you're using versions that play well together.
