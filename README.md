## Introduction

In an age where AI permeates every facet of our lives, Jarviso stands out, not just for its intelligence but also for its adaptability, context-awareness, and thirst for knowledge. Whether you're a novice user or a tech titan like Elon Musk, Jarviso promises a seamless and enlightening experience.

## Features

- **Contextual Conversations:** Unlike standard AIs that treat each query in isolation, Jarviso remembers. It intelligently maintains a history, paving the way for meaningful dialogues.
- **Versatile Response Mechanisms:** Whether it's a local neural network, a vast knowledge base, the power of GPT, or even a browser-based search, Jarviso meticulously selects the best route to answer your query.
- **Curiosity Mode:** Every so often, Jarviso's innate curiosity is piqued, prompting it to delve deeper into topics, mutually enhancing its knowledge and your experience.
- **Dynamic and Modular:** Jarviso's architecture isn't just robust—it's dynamic. This means the potential for expansions, custom modules, and integrations is limitless.

## Deep Dive: How Jarviso Works

Jarviso is a blend of scientific wonder and sheer computational power. Here's an in-depth look at its inner workings:

1. **Dialogue Management:** At the core of our interactions, this module evaluates the context, history, and nature of a query to determine the best strategy to generate a response.

2. **Contextual Memory:** Serving as Jarviso's short-term memory, this component holds the conversation history. This ensures every AI response is contextually relevant and coherent, allowing a more human-like conversation flow.

3. **Knowledge Extraction:** Before diving into complex computations, Jarviso first checks its knowledge base—a vast repository of pre-defined answers and the wisdom from WordNet. This comprehensive lexical database aids Jarviso in understanding word relationships, meanings, and even synonyms.

4. **Decision Making:** This is where the magic happens. We utilize a local neural network trained on embeddings, acting as Jarviso's cognitive center. Here, based on patterns and past interactions, it makes critical decisions on how to respond to user inputs.

5. **GPT Integration:** For some queries, especially the more intricate ones, Jarviso harnesses the power of external AI models like GPT. The responses from GPT, however, are not taken at face value. Jarviso evaluates and refines them, cross-referencing with WordNet and other internal systems, ensuring the highest quality of response.

6. **Neural Network Training:** Jarviso doesn't just rely on pre-trained models. Over time, using feedback, it refines its internal neural network. This continuous learning mechanism, combined with data from WordNet and GPT, ensures Jarviso becomes smarter and more adept at handling a wider range of topics with every interaction.

7. **API Interactions:** When external knowledge is needed, Jarviso seamlessly taps into the capabilities of giants like GPT, integrating vast external knowledge bases into its concise and intelligent responses.

By fusing traditional AI principles with cutting-edge machine learning models and lexical databases, Jarviso promises not just answers, but a truly evolved conversational experience.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Get the Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jarviso.git
cd jarviso
```
2. **Dependencies:** Jarviso stands on the shoulders of giants. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **API Configuration:** To converse with external entities, you'll need to set up API keys. Edit `config/api_keys.json` with your credentials.

## User Guide

Starting a conversation with Jarviso is as simple as:
```bash
python main.py
```
Now, just type away! Pose your questions, and experience the intelligence of Jarviso in real-time.

## For the Enthusiasts: Under the Hood

If you're someone who loves to tinker, or perhaps you're Lex Fridman, diving deep into AI research, Jarviso's modular design is a paradise. Each component, from the dialogue manager to the API handlers, has been meticulously crafted, allowing for easy expansions and deep dives into specific functionalities.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Type Errors:** Ensure all items in the context manager are strings. Non-string types can cause unexpected errors.
- **TensorFlow Warnings:** TensorFlow, being a dynamic beast, sometimes has compatibility quirks. Ensure you're using versions that play well together.
